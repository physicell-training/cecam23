# CECAM 2023 
This repository includes slides, recordings, source code, and resources for the CECAM 2023 workshop (March 2023). 

## Setup Materials 

### PhysiCell set-up guides

#### MacOS Setup
* Slides: [click here](https://github.com/physicell-training/ws2022/raw/main/setup/PhysiCell_ws2022_macOS_setup.pdf)
* Video: [click here](https://youtu.be/Sq9nfKS5U0E)

#### Windows Setup
* Slides: [click here](https://github.com/physicell-training/ws2022/raw/main/setup/PhysiCell_ws2022_Windows_setup.pdf) 
* Video: [click here](https://youtu.be/hIP4JUrViRA)
  
#### Linux Setup
Linux users can most likely skip setup g++ and Python setup, but they should download [PhysiCell 1.10.4 (or later)](https://github.com/MathCancer/PhysiCell/releases/latest) to test that they can compile and run the sample projects. See either the Windows or MacOS guide for details. 

#### Further help
You can get setup help in our [dedicated PhysiCell Slack workspace](https://join.slack.com/t/physicellcomm-sf93727/shared_invite/zt-qj1av6yd-yVeer8VkQaNDjDz7fF00jA). 

### PhysiMESS set-up guide
With PhysiCell setup you should be ready to run PhysiMESS

## Key components in code
If you look in the [code](https://github.com/physicell-training/cecam23/tree/main/code) directory, you'll see: 
* [PhysiCell](https://github.com/physicell-training/cecam23/tree/main/code/PhysiCell) - this is a sneak peak of the upcoming 1.11.0 release, which we'llk use throughout the workshop. 
* [PhysiCell Model Builder](https://github.com/physicell-training/cecam23/tree/main/code/PhysiCell-model-builder) - This is an integrated environment for setting up, running, and visualizing PhysiCell simulations. 
* [PhysiMESS](https://github.com/physicell-training/cecam23/tree/main/code/PhysiMESS) - This is a snapshot of the PhysiMESS extension to PhysiCell, which is tailored to ECM modeling. 

We will run most of our tutorials and sessions within these directories, and we'll rely upon this relative pathing. 

## Other suggested tools. 
The setup guides should already suggest ImageMagick. We also recommend [Microsoft VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as a good, cross-platform code editor.
