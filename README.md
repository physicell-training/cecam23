* Video: [click here](https://youtu.be/hIP4JUrViRA)
  
#### Linux Setup
Linux users can most likely skip setup g++ and Python setup, but they should download [PhysiCell 1.10.4 (or later)](https://github.com/MathCancer/PhysiCell/releases/latest) to test that they can compile and run the sample projects. See either the Windows or MacOS guide for details. 

#### Further help
You can get setup help in our [dedicated Slack workspace](https://join.slack.com/t/physicellcomm-sf93727/shared_invite/zt-qj1av6yd-yVeer8VkQaNDjDz7fF00jA).
